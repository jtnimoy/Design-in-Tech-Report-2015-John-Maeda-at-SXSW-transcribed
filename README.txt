Slide 1

ok, let's see here. Let's bring up the presentation on the enterprise deck. Okay, so um, this is the #DesignInTech report, and it's the first report of it's kind. I hope there will be future reports. There were all kinds of things we couldn't push into the report so i think there will be reportlets after this that will be born.

Slide 2

Um but to give you a summary of what you're gonna see, it's in roughly 5 parts. Each part is a different shape and size. The first part is the data one so if you like numbers, we've got numbers. We've also got people. I like people more than numbers, but we'll give you both.

Slide 3

So first of all, the data of #DesignInTech

Slide 4

Just studying the history in M&A activity for design firms, it was very interesting because I remember in 2013 hearing about my friend Maria Judice's studio, Hot Studio, being acquired by Facebook and I thought: woah, that's crazy. Because, most design firms get acquired by holding companies. But that was a big tech company acquiring a pretty big design firm. And if you look backward in history, there were 4 prior to that, acquired by tech companies. And since Hot Studio, A lot more studios have been acquired. It points to the fact that making a design firm _is_ making a company, _is_ making value – for the tech economy.

Slide 5

And if you think about that, and you wonder "why is that?", uh, there's a reason for this all. The first reason is that there was a way we used to think. And you remember when Pentium came out? pentium 150, 160, 170. We kept buying it over and over because it was faster. That was the reason we buy things –  because there was more technology. We wanted the faster CPU, we wanted more memory; that's how we were happy. But, what's happened today is: that _Moore's Law_ style of thinking is no longer as effective. It isn't good enough to make it twice as fast. It has to feel better to me, the person. And in that sense, this is a new way of thinking. It's a way of thinking where design matters.

Now, I had the opportunity through Rhode Island School of Design to get to know um Joe and Brian who are the cofounders of AirBnB. And, I would follow what they were doing because these were two design school grads forming a tech startup in Silicon Valley.

Slide 6

And, I loved when um Brian was interviewed and he says: Being designers, _they_ (whether it's the VC or any other kind of people) thought we were people that worked for people that ran companies. That is the way people thought about design . . . and tech. But, if you see how that's changed, um, it's quite interesting.

Slide 7

Now, if you look back to 2005, 2006, a notable designer cofounded a company we all know, _Youtube_ , was acquired by Google for 1.65 billion dollars, and there wasn't many more after that. Um but 2008 is the key year in our current analysis. 2008 is when a little company you may know this little um, little piece of graphic, a little company called _Mint_ was acquired by Intuit. And why was that a key inflection point, an inflection point that led to so many more cofounded companies by designers, acquired by tech? It's because Mint was the harbinger of this idea that you had to design something that was responsive, web 2.0 at the time, but also understood mobile as something consumers were moving to. Now, I'm gonna go over and over about this point about the fact that 2008 was the year when design got really important, and I'll explain why.

Slide 8

I wanna note that by working in venture capital, I have access to all kinds of interesting databases that aren't available at a library *chuckles* and uh, I was looking at this insights database, and looking up the top . . . let's see, there's internet category, US only, I was looking for the companies that had been a recent raise, and the companies that had been raised the most, historically. Top cumulative funded um venture backed startups. 25 of them. And in the Internet category, I began looking at who founded these companies. And what was so interesting is that there were a few companies that were co-founded by designers. k, so I wanna like, feel you all together. We're gonna count together. ok? so . . . There's ONE, ONE: Fab.com. There's TWO, TWO: Pinterest. There's THREE, THREE: AirBnB. There's FOUR, FOUR: Vice Media. There's FIVE, FIVE: Lynda.com and if I can do my mathematics correctly, that is 20% of the top VC funded backed companies in this category are cofounded by designers. Who would have thought? And I have to say to you, in the process of looking at this, I've been surprised all along the way – quite pleasantly surprised because you can see a kind of pattern. And, I was able to have the fortune of learning about this pattern because in January of last year, I joined Kleiner Perkins as _Design Partner_ . . . 

Slide 9

. . . a position that is not defined yet in the industry, but it's under construction, really. And, I had never been to this area of the country. I never lived in it, I didn't really go so often to it, but I quickly learned about this thing called _Sand Hill Road_, *sarcastically* the road paved with gold. Um, and I had no idea I was on Sand Hill Road. I was like: woah this is really cool. And I noticed that after I was named Design Partner on Sand Hill Road, shortly thereafter, 3 more firms picked up design . . . partner . . . people. Not only that, 3 more firms picked up design partner people outside of sand hill road. Why is this interesting? It's interesting because it sees a pattern where the investment world sees the value of design in technology, wants to understand it, it's moving from a nice-to-have competency to a need-to-have competency. 

Slide 10

So, if we think about it, 27 startups cofounded by designers, 10 agencies acquired by tech in the last 4 years and by the way, Enrique Allen from designer fund just sent me an email an hour ago. The number is actually incorrect. There are *perks up* many more actually *grins* so this number will change . . . and it's gonna go up.

Second thing is 5 startups cofounded by designers (that chart I showed you) if you add up all the money they've raised, it's 2.75 billion dollars in 5 companies alone. There are many more companies cofounded by designers, in the venture capital industry, we're gonna try and add those up in the next coming months. 

And lastly, 6 venture capital firms are welcoming designers to their team – and not to design their logo, but to design how the business works with respect to technology.

Slide 11

If I were asked "what's gonna happen next?" if you just do a linear projection (which is not too uh, high tech) more M&A activity of designer-led businesses will happen. More designer-led startups will have the opportunity to raise capital. Don't forget that Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia had a hard time raising capital when they were starting out. It's a different climate. The venture industry is more open to designer-led startups. And lastly, Design in VC, for me, has been about making it very clear that it isn't about making this beautiful, delightful thing. It's about having a clear systems thinking view about how the design matters in regards to design, technology, and business. 

Slide 12

That was part 1. That was a number part. Let's go on to part 2. part 2 are a few thoughts I have about design, tech, and business in general – a kind of passion, a kind of hobby I've had along the way.

Slide 13

One thing that I've noticed is that over the years that when technology companies make technology, they make it, and they'll _spray_ design at the very end. The so-called _lipstick on the pig_ . It's like: "made the technology. phew, i'm done. so tired. now let's add the design to make it desirable." which, if you think about it; it's a very cost-effective approach. it's like: ok, made the thing, now let's put some design into it. The more expensive approach is to begin with design from the beginning. Start with design, not just end with it. If you think about people who love their Nest™. It's because it was designed with design from the beginning. Now the problem with that, as I mentioned, is that it gets much more expensive. You're like: omg, it's like so much more expensive. If I just did it at the end, it would be so much cheaper. But what's happening is that design is moving from this idea of a _cost_ to an _investment_ . It has a greater return whether in dollars or in euros. It's a good idea. Again, it's not just something you add at the end. It's something that's strategic, and vital, so you put it in the beginning and you pay for it.

Slide 14

Um, and if you think about design again, design isn't about the beautiful, it's about combining great business thinking abd great engineering thinking. People often ask me, "John, so are you saying design is more important than engineering?" I'm not saying that. You can have a beautiful car. If you couldn't drive it, it wouldn't be so useful. So engineering in tech is vital, it has to work, it has to work at scale, but design can work in tandem with it. You interlace business thinking with it, and you'll have something that's affordable and profitable.

Slide 15

Now, when we think about *stammers* when ever anyone asks me like what's a good design tech thing or like when someone asks you, i'm sure, you can't help but say the word "Apple", it's like "argh it just came out Apple." *grins* And um when you think about the ... everyone knows them, everyone has them, the Macbook Unibody. Remember when that came out? It was polycarb before that, then it was the *flashes eyes* Macbook Unibody. And, it was this amazing new object.

[plays video of original Apple television commercial found around 1:30 of this youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RInwNDZgF84 ]

Do you remember this? The Jony Ives voice over? from a single piece of "aluminium" *audience laughs* and it was a story of this amazing design. It's incredible. You could never have it before and now you have it, brought to you by Apple. But the real story brought up by several great business reporters was that it wasn't about the design per say. It was the fact that Apple could lock down all the CNC milling machine, the lasers, get the aluminum taken care of, you know, at a good price. And so, why is this important? It's important because Apple is able to produce a beautiful object that you might not have been able to afford – that everyone else, everyone couldn't afford – that Apple couldn't have a high enough margin around. It was a combination of business thinking and design thinking.

And so you might say to yourself: well only apple can do that. It turns out that companies have been doing it all the time. 

Slide 16

Um, I find this great example of the Vienna coffee house chair. It was design by Michael Thonet in the 1800's. Any of you who have been to Europe have seen them. They're in all the coffee shops in Paris. They're ubiquitous. The story behind this chair is that Michael Thonet invented a way to manufacture this chair, uh, very cheaply. He had a patented way to bend birchwood through steam and he had 5 factories across Eastern Europe producing these things in the 1800s. By 1870, he had showrooms in Brussels, and Chicago, and New York, and he was selling them all over the place. But it wasn't just the design that mattered, or just the how it looked and how it felt. It was the fact that 36 Thonet chairs could fit inside a 1-meter cube box. Which is a big deal. When you think about it, putting them into a 1-meter cube box in 1800s is very good for shipping, therefore desirable. Good logistics, great IP protection, great design aesthetics – all those came together. When those all come together, you have great design. 

Slide 17

So, why should you and businesses care about #DesignInTech ? This is part 3. Well, this is an old story to tell you. Uh but um, in 4th grade, *removes eyeglasses from face* my parents took me to a parent-teacher conference. And the teacher, you know, one of those like, uh, Arts sort of like Gifted teacher, teachers that says "omg, yer son. ya know, he's so good math and art"

Slide 18

and the next day in the tofu store where I grew up, my father was telling his friend. He said, "you know, we went to John's parent-teacher-association meeting. he said John is good at math!" *audience laughs* and I just paused a little like a head fake, well why didn't Dad say "And art" ? You know? And I've always wondered about that. And so, because of that, I went to MIT. I did all the math type of stuff. I went to art school later. And when I came back from art school, I came back to actually MIT. And at MIT in 1996, I had the great joy of getting to work at the Media Lab as it was scaling. Now, I wanna note that I remember it was around the year 2000 when this kinda bad moment occurred. I was in this meeting and I saw Nicholas Negroponte who was looking at his computer and all these numbers were turning red, like "bad" and I didn't understand what was happening because I had no money. He had more money. What is he worried about? I'm not sure. Um and so, it was this moment where of course, there was a dot com crash. And I was right there in the middle of it, in tech central at MIT. I always thought about that moment. Like, what was that moment? How did we get through it? And in general life, how do you get through anything? How do you get through any kind of challenge? And at that moment, of course in my mind, I heard the theme of _Lord of the Rings_. You know, *hums some notes* and I thought, I wanted to find this clip online to share with all of you, but there's copyright issues i understand. so just that day, this last week, I saw my friend Ge Wang, he's a professor at Stanford who did the Ocarina for the iPhone, and I asked him to make a little video.

[video showing Ge Wang in a music lab, playing the _Lord of the Rings_ theme on the Ocarina iPhone app]

There we go *audience laughs and claps* can we applaud for Doctor Wang? Thank you, there we go. A nice guy. Um, so anyways, because of this moment, I always wondered what was Mordor? What happened? What is this money thing? And I remembered people always saying to me, "John, you're the design guy. You're the creative guy. So don't worry about the money. We'll worry about the money." and after 5 people tell you that in your life . . . you start worrying. *audience laughs* Like, shouldn't I be worried about it? You know? And so, because I was worried about it, I went on a quest to understand money. I got my MBA to understand what the heck people were saying to me. And that was so helpful. And that began my sort of venture outside the Shire of MIT and the academic land. 

Slide 19

Um and I had this great moment in 2008 when I joined RISD as the president, and I remember vividly, I had been given all these books on the first hundred days. You seen those books, the first hundred days books like the first days of being a leader, you know that? Well, we had them. And, you know every book would say, "whatever you do, don't have a vision" because you're not supposed to have a vision. The vision is about the place. Find the vision on the way. What does everyone ask you when they meet you? "what's you vision?". And you're like omg, this is like really hard. Um and so, I remember I had plans to address 600 high school students who were in the summer art program. And I thought what a great chance to beta test some ideas. And so I wrote some things down on a piece of paper, hurried over to the auditorium. It was summer, it was hot, it was sweaty, and I went over these ideas. I asked them to applaud for the one that they wanted me to do. You know, so it was like audience test kinda thing. So, the first one was something like um "life long education in art and design". That was not very popular. Uh, the second one was more in the ego section, like oh um, "fostering the next generation of super talent" . . . and that was only slightly better. And I was about to give up. And I had this last one that I called "building a justifiable case for creativity in our world". and what happened is um everyone clapped. It was like this rock concert moment. Everyone was so excited and people had green hair, and all kinda hair, and t-shirts, whatever. So psyched, but I didn't know why they were so psyched . . . til an hour later, when I was shopping in the alumni store, and a young woman came up to me.

She said that oh, "i'm so glad you said what you said in there."

and i said, "well what did i say?"

and she said "well, i'm a sophomore in Nebraska. i'm in highschool, a sophomore in Nebraska. I'm the creative one. I'm the weird one. No one takes me seriously. And you said in the auditorium you would fight for us."

and it was then that I knew that that was the mission. How do you fight for creative people? How do you do that? And so by joining Kleiner Perkins, I had the fortune of being asked by Mary Meeker who published these Internet trend reports about adding a slide to her deck on ...

Slide 20

... user interfaces and how user interfaces that were bad could no longer live. And then I began studying all of Mary Meeker's slides. And I discovered that in 2001, when she was first talking about the Internet, she was saying how user interface would determine winning. Not only that, it has been brought up over many years by her reports. Um and so over time, Mary has been always talking about the importance of user experience, would lead to more consumers adopting the Internet. And so building on that, became a kind of passion. How do you make that more visible? Why is this actually happening? So, I went off on a journey on a few old thoughts I had that had to do with the use of space. Scott Heiferman who is the CEO of meetup.com a long time ago, we were in Italy together or something, he was talking about this concept.

Slide 21

He was saying before we had the television, we had this thing called the coffee table. It was a technology. You sit around it, and you drink coffee, and talk. And then, the TV was invented, and you would sit around it. And then, the PC was invented and you would sit in front of it. Everyone would sit in front of their computer, in a living room like this. And then, after the mobile phone, what happened is we began to shine a computer in our face. Not only me, but all of you and all of us. And so we're in this age where we're shining computers in our faces, and we know it's different, it feels a bit odd, but what is it doing to us? What is that effect? So, I began to look at that, and thought about in the old days, you'd like turn the computer on and check email once in the morning, once in the evening. And if that experience wasn't good, you would only have 2 ouches, right?

Slide 22

Ouch! Morning. uggh, that wasn't good. Then you get back up, and again ouch! Evening. You know, it wasn't that good. But the mobile era, according to the recent statistics I found in Mary's report, there's an android study on 150 unlocks per day which is roughly every 5.6 minutes. If you think about it, that's like a whole lot of ouch. *mild audience chuckle* so it isn't a pain point, it's a pain plane – like a bed of nails. If something hurts, it's gonna hurt ya all day old. That's not good. Bad design hurts, good design hurts less. 

Slide 23

And most of the statistics that we see are about the number of users. You know how the number of users of computers has skyrocketing, it's like 3 billion, ya know? and it's like woah, that's a big number - and it's been increasing every year. But one thing I noticed is that none of these statistics speak to the fact that we use the computer more often. Like in the 90s, we use the computer like this much and now in 2015, we're using the computer a lot. So, I built this simple mathematical model to describe what that curve looks like and if you look at the curve, it looks more like this. When we think about mobile, this has occurred. There is usage inflation in the user's curve. And that's why mobile is so critical. It's the first time that we're all using computers together. Computers were for nerds before. Now they're for everyone. By the way, I'm a nerd and I love nerds so . . . that's ok. *audience giggles*

Um, and you wonder is this a new phenomenon. You remember when I mentioned the chairs from Michael Thonet? This is not a new phenomenon. Think about the car industry. The car industry was one of the first tech industries. If you think about it, the 1950s was a hay day for a company called GM.

Slide 24

GM had hired in the 50s, the first VP of design at any major corporation which was a big signal. It was a signal that design mattered at the executive level, and it mattered because ... it was strategic because car acquisitions was going down. And Harley Earl came in and designed the first cars with fins, inspired by jets. And so, the cars became desirable – became a passionate thing. Now that was not enough though. That's just about users. What also happened was usage. Eisenhower had just declared the Federal Highway Act. And so what happened is the interstate highway came in place. So driving became a lifestyle thing. Hey Honey, let's go drive and go to vacation in the Grand Canyon. You know? We could use the cars more. It became a lifestyle choice. It was the first internet of things. Things move around on it. And so the combination of those two factors led to GM's outstanding success at the time. People will say "well GM isn't doing good now" but remember, in that era, it was doing amazing. 

Slide 25

Now, I notice people often ask me "so how do I improve my design? Like, what should I do?" and that's a hard question. The easiest answer that I give is "you have to have good designers" because design is done by people, it's not done by technology. You can't find a new algorithm to improve design with some kind of hockey curve effect. You have to cultivate good designers; good design culture.

Slide 26

Klaus Schwab founder of the World Economic Forum talked about how we're moving from a world of capitalism to 'talentism'. And on that theme, I've invited Jackie Xu, talent partner from Kleiner to come on up, Jackie Xu, will you please welcome Jackie Xu? *audience applauses*

Jackie: Hi everyone, how are you guys?

John: Um, so I remember walking into Kleiner Perkins. This is the first day and we open the door and I walked into this person I didn't know, Jackie, and I quickly learned about jackie's background. Jackie has been a long time engineering talent recruiter. So, engineering talent. How does it all happen for you? 

Jackie: yeah, so I uh, moved back to San Francisco in 2009 from New York where I was in the big bad world of finance. When I came to San Francisco, I was very inspired by all these engineers who could take an idea and build a product around it. And so that's how I got into engineering recruiting. At first, we were at facebook, and in 2010, I joined a hundred person startup known as Twitter. Over the course of the 4 years, my team and I helped hire over a thousand engineers for Twitter. 

John: thousand engineers. That's a lot. 

Jackie: yes.

John: that's like more than 10.

*audience laughs*

Jackie: yes, and if you think about it, a thousand may seem like a lot. What are all these people doing? Maybe they're, you know, just playing games, err uh, tweeting. But actually, you have someone that has an idea – one or two people that have an idea, and in order to build a scalable business, you need the engineers in the background to _build_ the technology. Um, to put it in perspective, there's about half a billion tweets being sent every day. And I see some of you out there with phones. Well, I bet some of you are tweeting, and if you are, please use our hashtag, #DesignInTech.

John: good plug, thank you. Um so, working with Jackie, from the engineering talent perspective, it has been great because I had the chance to talk about design with her - and also learned about design in a new way.

Slide 27

Because the word "Design" is so hard to understand. There is no single definition. If you ask one person, 10 people, 100 people, you get all kinds of definitions, so what you're seeing here is a first experiment to sort of mine the database, understand design. That work will be forthcoming.

But in order to make it easier to understand this Design thing, we went out and did a study. Jackie can talk about people we studied.

Slide 28

Jackie: um yes, we had over a hundred people who were a mix of entrepreneurs, leaders, and designers. And what was really interesting from this study was that more than half of these people associated themselves as self-taught, even though they had formal college degrees. That's huge, right? I'll give you a great example of one of these people. She's right here on the first row, her name's Rochelle King. She is the global VP of design for Spotify. She started out in her undergrad studying art history. Then she went on and got a masters in applied sciences, and structural engineering. So she started her career working with silicon wafers. She also took some coding classes and back then, they were teaching the Pascal language. Which, I don't know if anyone's coding in Pascal now. 

John: Pascal people? *raises hand* All right, we rock.

jackie: um, and so, you know, and now she's leading design for a global music streaming service. So art history major, material scientist, and now design leader. She is what we see as a MULTI disciplinary person. It used to be a lot of people who were INTER disciplinary. Now, we're seeing a big shift of people becoming more MULTI disciplinary. 

John: You see this so often. I'm sure many of you are "slash people". Like i'm this slash this slash this. And so, that pattern has been replicated all over the place. It's a good pattern. I know that it wasn't fun during a certain era to be a "mutant", now it's okay *grin* which I like. I like this era a lot. I like this era a lot. In the 90s, I was mentioning to jackie a while ago when um, I remember there was a time when if you were someone who was in engineering, you never thought you could be a designer. I remember a time when you were a fine artist or designer who wanted to learn how to code at scale. People would believe you couldn't do it. But what's been so interesting in this study is that a lot of people are hybrids. They are "multi" people like Jackie said. 

Slide 29

And that's so important today. There are people who are fine arts and business. There are all kinds of people out there in this design-tech sector. So it's a vibrant place of people with all kinds of backgrounds. It's a welcome place for people who bring different kinds of perspectives; who can do both.

And I remember _programming_ was such a bad word. I remember I was at a party in New York and uh, I sat down for the dinner thing, you know? And it was in the 90s, and I sat down and you know how you go around the table and say what's your name, what's your name, name, name, name and then I said "I'm John Maeda whatever" and then someone just stops the dinner and says "I hate you." *Jackie giggles* I said "I don't know why you hate me. I don't even know who you are". So he said "well you think programming is important. It's not. It's bad. It's really bad for you." and it's like woah, sorry man. Um but what was so interesting in this survey we did online for 374 disciplines, it was overwhelmingly positive.

Slide 30

This is senior, junior, mid-level talent. It didn't regard who or how long you were in the industry, uh, there is a belief that coding is important, which is quite exciting. It isn't the way it was in the past. It's a new world, and I'm excited by that. Super excited, actually.

Slide 31

And if you think about it, business schools are interesting places to understand because it gives you kind of a good measure for what's coming and Jackie, you delved into this data. Go ahead.

Jackie: Yes we uh, took a deep look at the top 10 business schools both internationally and also within the US. And what we noticed was that these MBAs from the top business schools were rallying to have their own design clubs. So 70% out of the top business schools are all having student-led design organizations where they are bringing guest speakers – people like John, other folks from the industry to speak about design thinking, and educate them around design and innovation.

John: and when I saw this, I was so surprised because I remember I was invited to different design clubs in business schools, and this is 70%. What that means is that the curriculum, business schools aren't changing fast enough. So the students are compensating, and what is happening is that business school will then adapt much quicker. So, and I also know, I was talking to Jules Pieri who is the CEO of The Grommet, a designer-founded company. She was the first Harvard MBA in the 80s, and uh, as a fine arts person. And so if you are a fine arts person who wants to get an MBA, it's OK. I have an MBA. I haven't like lost anything. *audience chuckles* So it's a good world out there in business school if you can believe. It's exciting.

Jackie: great advice too, you know, from the hundred and ten people that we studied. One of the advices was "learn how to learn". And so the MBA schools are really smart in that they are seeking things outside the curriculum. They're learning how to learn. 

John: I love students. Um, I do actually. Um so, I wanna note that by working with Jackie, really, I had no idea what the venture capital industry did, I kinda knew but I've learned very quickly. I knew something about the startup space, and I've learned with so many people in startup, and through Jackie, how things work. I was so struck when Jackie was talking about how important it is in your team building to make sure you hire that first team well,

Slide 32

and here is the post she gave on LinkedIn. I guess this last week, they've been doing very well. But Jackie also looked at different people that study, and found something else.

Jackie: so what we found was surprising to a lot of us. Those companies who are starting out now, the ratio of designer to engineer is much higher. So, for every 4 to 5 engineers, there's 1 designer. And that's important because most startups are ranging from a few people to maybe 30 people. And so that ratio of 1:4 or 1:5 sends a very strong signal that design matters. 

John: my first reaction was "that's great" and I showed it to one designer and he said "oh well it should be 1:1". you know "why isn't it 1:1?" you know and . . .

jackie: yeah, well and if you look at historically, it was often times, the initial team didn't have a designer. Often times, design was brought in at the 50th hire, or much later on. So I think that this is a move in the right direction and you often don't need 1:1. Because, with some of the products you're building, they're complex. You may need a mobile engineer, you need a couple of other people on the team. 

John: yeah, so isn't it interesting? I mean, if you thought of it like 10 years ago, would this be the ratio, those of you in the industry know that wasn't the case. So this is changing and what's so great is that it shows the importance of design at the beginning, from the get go. 

And I wanna note that last year, I had another experience working with a . . .  *jackie exits stage* That's Jackie Xu, thank you jackie *audience claps* . . . and um, fun day to work with jackie. And last year, I worked with the CEO of EBay company, John Donahoe who invited me to not work on a startup, but what I call and end-up. You know, a startup wants to end up successful, EBay ended up successful. Huge company, "how do you bring design/culture back?" was the question. And my point was: well design culture is already there. you have designers in a large company. You have to pull them together. I know that Billy Cybrick is here. He worked on that movement. Billy, there you are. But it was exciting because 

Slide 33

by the way, Dane Howard who worked on this as well, has a great post on LinkedIn if you wanna look at more about this. It was a simple fact that the CEO cared about design. In one year, the entire company began to pull design into its core. I believe it's unprecedented. The speed at which design was made important at the executive level was phenomenal. We engaged 10s, then 100s, then 1000s of people inside the EBay company. There's gonna be a Stanford business school case study about this effort.

What did it say to me? It said to me that leadership matters, but it also said to me that FOLLOWER-ship matters. Lemmy give an example. So I remember last year in April, there was an event that pulled together a few hundred people, Billy was there, and all the designers and product people and then John gave this talk with Brian Chesky about design. Four months prior, there were doubts about design mattering at the executive level. But at that moment, everyone saw that design was mattering and so a bunch of people came up to John and said "Thank you for caring about design." It was in that moment in milliseconds, John reached over to his head of global communications and said "the executive retreat with the hundreds of vice presidents is gonna be about design." It was a moment where I saw that followership can change leadership, because a leader wants to lead their people. If the people want design to happen, the leader will change as well. So, that's something you can look at later, online. But it was a pleasure to see. 

Slide 34

Oh look at that, we're coming towards the end, so Final Thoughts. Um so, I tried to share with you this idea of the "old".

Slide 35

When people think of "old", they think it's something kinda historical, kinda irrelevant. But I think this crowd feels differently about it, I can see your eyes are shining. This information is useful because having past precedent allows pattern matching to occur, on significant moments. And things like the Thonet chair you may never thought about ... I never thought about ... I'm gonna use over and over as an example of "like the macbook". It's an old example, it worked really well. People like to use patterns because they're safe. Design is historically a good pattern for business success. 

There's also the "new" and the tech economy – the fact that this new world is changing and design is adapting, there are great designs, and great designers, and great companies, and you always ask "is the new more important than the old?" But what I've always believed is: it isn't about the old and the new. You know how there's the _cloud_ ? I call it the dirt. It's the old stuff. Um, you need both to make great things happen. Because _good_ lies somewhere in between. It's a combination of the old, and the new. They cross-fertilize, they become MULTI, they become INTER, and new things happen... like companies – modern tech companies, led, co-led, first-employee, first 10 hired designer, this is happening right now. And I think especially SXSW. People who come here can feel that new energy around creativity and this deck was designed to have that purpose: to build a justifiable case for creativity. So, all these slides are going to be available public, they are already all on the Kleiner Perkins website to share with friends, to share to your boss, to your uh, people, to re-think what design is and how to use it inside your company, and what their companies are doing, And if there are any things we need to add to it, please tweet at us so we can add to this corpus and hopefully offer you a new report that shows you progress.

Slide 36

And just to sort of go back to this old and new frame, you know, Apple is , again, lauded as this amazing company, that's an amazing design. And if you look at the fortune 500 list, it's in the top 10. There's the SVP of design, Jonny Ive, but let's not forget that General Motors has a vice president of design. Many of the top fortune 500, 100 companies have a vice president, executive vice president, or a CEO that cares about design. Note that the CEO of Nike is an industrial designer. 

So, they're all out there. We can see them more clearly. I'm hoping that I'll be able to spend more focus on this kind of data, so you can all share with your constituencies, to rethink how design sits in your company. It's not just about the pretty things . . . so many people say "this is pretty, John. You'll like it". I'm like "why am I gonna like it?" you know? The example I always give is my friend Naoto Fukasawa, how designs for MUJI and other companies like that. He's a very modernist kind of person. He says that he always designs for the _after-wow_. Now, what's the after-wow? And he says "most people design for the wow". Like *shallow, loud tone* "wow, that's amazing." He designs for the after-wow. The after-wow is to buy in a store, you bring it home, you've owned it for a month, and you're looking at it, and you're saying, *calm, reflective tone* wow. The after-wow is that notion that you know why it deserves to be, why it lives in your world, it didn't wow you to be bought, it's earned your confidence. It was the right price, it makes you feel the right way, that's what great design is about.

As a great lesson, because I love working with so many young people in a startup ecosystem because I learn so much from them, whether it's design, technology, or even about leadership. I was visiting Facebook campus, and who knows Sun Microsystems? *raises hand* awww, there we go. Wasn't it awesome? 

Slide 37

That was the Ferrari of workstations. People had PCs and sun workstations, come on! *audience laughs* and so for technologists, it was an amazing, super high powered car. Well, you had to have a Sun workstation to do research. Um, but I love how if you look at Facebook, there's a sign of Sun Microsystems. You know all kinda cobwebbed and over. It is actually the back of the Facebook corporate sign. I think it's so amazing because it shows you how we've changed. We've moved from tech-for-techies to tech-for-people . . .

Slide 38

. . . Real people, and real people like design. In many cases, you want to make the design that they love in tech. OK, so now I have an official disclosure. For this deck, it's available online right now, I hope you have a chance to use it, thank you for coming. You guys could have gone drinking or had some other fun activity out there, but you chose to come here. Thank you so much. *audience begins applauding* Thank you to jackie, and we're done!
